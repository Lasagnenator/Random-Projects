particles.txt is encoded as follows:
====SAMPLE LINE====
(x, y, z, vx, vy, vz, rx, ry, rz, type)
====SAMPLE LINE====
Where 'type' is either 0,1 or 2 for proton, neutron and electron
x,y and z are integers in attometres (10^-18 metres) from 0,0,0
being the origin of the world.
vx,vy,vz is the vector of movement of particle
rx,ry,rz is the spin in degrees along each axis
