How to use:
1. run program
2. enter maximum energy level to be computed
3. enter precision level to be computed
4. close window to move to the next window
5. close console window to finish or let the program finish itself

IMPORTANT
This orbital plotter will only plot points on the xy plane. 

Precision is a number that drastically impacts performance!
Computation time is increased exponentially and so is cpu usage.
This produces a barely notcable difference. Definately not worth the
computation time.

Should you get a flat colour as the screen, it means that it is a specific
orbital that has 0 as the values for all (x,y,0) points.
